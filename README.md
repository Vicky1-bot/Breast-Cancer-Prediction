# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible.
